  Jack   A while back someone had several equations which could be used for changing 3 f iltered grey scale images into one true color image.
  This is possible because it's the same theory used by most color scanners.
  I am not looking for the obv ious solution which is to buy a color scanner but what I do need is those equat ions becasue I am starting to write software which will automate the conversion  process.
  I would really appreciate it if someone would repost the 3 equations 3 unknowns.

   My (then) wife used to get recurrent yeast infections.
 One day, her doctor sent her home with medication for her and a pill for me.
 I took the pill, upon her insistence, and was very relieved the next day when I looked it up in the PDR.
 It only RARELY causes testicular atrophy...
  Anyway, men apparently do get yeast infections.

  Is there any plan to look at the affected HGA during the HST repair mission, to determine the cause of its limited range of motion?
  Is the affected HGA still limited, or is it now capable of full range of motion?

  The idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon (not necessarily rectangular) as a window.
  My problem then is in finding out all the new vertices of the resulting "subpolygons" from the first one.
  Is this simply a matter of extending the usual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked against another polygon???
  Is there a simpler way??

  The final diagnosis was Stress.
  I did not take her for a chiropractic adjustment.
 (Rachel receives all her medical care at Keller Army Hospital since she is a military dependant, and the Army does not yet provide chiropractic adjustments as part of its regular health care.)
  I am hoping that the arrival of (1) Spring Break, and (2) College Acceptance Letters, will help.
  *UNFORTUNATELY* she was wait-listed at the college she most dearly wanted to attend, so it seems as though that stressor may just continue for a while.
  :-(  Meanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group for spring break, which seems like a good stress-reliever to me.
  Does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly?
  Does  short-term use of the drug ever produce long-term side-effects after the use of the drug?
  My grandmother recently had to be hospitalized and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks.
  Although the drug has been terminated, she has changed from a perky, slightly senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance.
  It seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the course of just one and one-half months.
  I have to believe that the combination of the hospital stay and some drug(s) are in part catalysts for this.
  Any comments?
   I am posting this message for a friend of mine who does not have a computer account, if you have any questions please call Dan at (814)238-1804.

  A very simple question : it seems to me that the contraceptive pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to fall every month.
 But it does not prevent the fertilzation of the  ovule.
 Is it true ?
 If yes, is there a risk of extra-uterine pregnancy, that is the development of the ovule inside the Fallopian tube ?
